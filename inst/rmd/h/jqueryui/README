This a jQuery UI custom build, downloaded from:
https://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.13.2&components=111111111111111111111101111111111111111111111111

It includes all components except the datepicker, because it conflicts with
bootstrap-datepicker that is packaged with Shiny.

The copy of jQuery that is bundled with the download, under external/, is not
included because Shiny already has its own copy of jQuery.
